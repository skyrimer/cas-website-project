                <p>Hello! I am Kirill Chekemenev, and this is my personal website. Here I will share my
                  programming experience and try to
                  help others to follow my path. You are welcome to check out what I have achieved for
                  several
                  years!</p>

                <p>As I started to do my math internal assessment, I began looking for utilities to help
                  me
                  with it. I needed a program to help me set the points on a 2d plane, find the best
                  fit
                  function and give me the correlation coefficient. Soon it turned out that the last
                  two
                  issues were almost impossible to do on one website, so I had to play around with it.

              <div class="card-text">
                <p>I had never thought that I would need to have a file naming system. Here I am
                  scrolling
                  through my TOK files that are
                  called "TOK", "TOK thing", "TOK very thing", "TOK thingy thing", and "TOK 3
                  things"...
                  If you don't want to repeat my
                  mistakes, you can think of the systemising this process, and programming can help
                  you
                  with it.</p>

              <div class="card-text">
                <p>As a student with a lot of interests and one old laptop for all of them, sometimes I
                  wish
                  I had a different autorun
                  depending on what I am going to do. For instance, why would I need to have OneDrive
                  and
                  Microsoft Teams opening if I
                  want to play some video games and need the best performance possible? So, creating a
                  program that can find and run multiple background processes at once would be
                  excellent...</p>
